# Women in the tech industry (discussion)

During the (open space) Software Crafters Madrid 2018, more than 20 people have managed to sit together and discuss the topic of “Women in the tech industry”.

In [session_notes.md](session_notes.md) you can find some notes covering (most of?) the mentioned points. They have been classified in three groups: “questions”, “shared experiences”, and “thoughts”. 

Besides these “raw and dirty” notes, which try to achieve the “we want to document the sessions” goal, would be nice to end up with a list of actionable items/suggestions to be done/tried out in our teams/companies/organizations/communities. This would be the (soooo much needed) “we want to act after the sessions” part.

Anyone reading this: please, if you're really worried about the current status quo, and are willing to invest some of your time trying to fix it, please get in touch, I'd love to hear from (and help) you all :-)
